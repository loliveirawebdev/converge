# Routing Module

This module takes care of any routing related thing like: definition of routes, helper to navigate between screens/routes, custom scripts, routing components, etc.

You must know that we concentrate the routes definition in the config.ts file to make some "magic" to generate routes for react-native and nextjs.

If you need a route for a specific platform, you should define it on "config.mobile.ts" or "config.next.ts" file.
