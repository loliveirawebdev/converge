#Routing for NextJS

You are able to create specific routes for NextJS in here, but thinking about consistence and to smooth the development you can just edit the file "config.ts" located at "@/modules/Routing", and this framework will take care of all hard work to setup these routes to web and mobile.

You MUST NOT create files for routing, even it's only for web, in this folder.
Please take a look into @/modules/Routing folder.
